**This guide assumes you have at least a basic idea of what D&D _is_**. If the words **_role playing game_** make you think of risque bedroom antics, or the idea of **_choosing a race_** gives you flashbacks of signing up for that 10K fun run you regret, turn back now.

Instead, this guide is for people who **have expressed an interest in playing** D&D to their **resident nerd of the friendship group**, who then replied to them casually...

> **_"well you gotta' make a character then"_**

> "Make a character? What?"

In D&D, you don't win or lose. You role play a character and participate in hilarious antics and ridiculous shenanigans until you're bored. Its a thousand times better than it sounds, trust me.

> Role play?

**Acting, I'm talking about acting.** You will roll dice, however, to determine if the things you want to do are successful or not! But that all comes much later- baby steps, people. **For now, lets just decide what race your character is. _So choose one._**

> "Choose a race?"

Yep - basically your species in the world. Your race is the core of who you are; it determines your physical characteristics, how others in the world will react to you, plus any natural benefits or disadvantages you might have.

> "I'm not sure what race I want to play as though, what if I get it wrong?"

Don't sweat it! For starters, **_there is no wrong._** Sure, there are differences, but they're all pretty well balanced, and besides, **this is a role playing game.** Think about what kind of thing you want to be in this fantasy world, and **go for it!**

As for choosing a race, if you're really stuck, think of a character you like from a book or film.

Like Gimli from Lord of the Rings? **Boom, you're a Dwarf!**

Enjoy the idea of talking down to people, being smug all the time, and pissing around with bows and arrows in the woods? **Easy, an Elf.**

Enjoy the idea of being a cool outsider who can breathe fire? _Also you kinda wanna fuck Eragon?_ **Awesome, you're a Dragonborn**

## Dwarves

![Unknown, Dwarf Lord by Tze Kun Chin, Dwarf Guard by Daniel Zrom and Dwarven Boar Riders by Matthew Melmeth](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*rKyu2as9D9NAfPSk-4R7FQ.jpeg)

Standard fantasy Dwarves. See: **_Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit._**

Live to be around 400, hold grudges, slightly magical - **_like a Yorkshire grandad_**. Can see in the dark. **_Unlike a Yorkshire grandad._**

Get bonuses to anything related to being "hardy" or stonework, earth, etc. Naturally tough, and get bonuses to saving throws against poison, poison based damage, that sort of thing. Basically, a super tough constitution and endurance. **_If in doubt, think Gimli._**

## Elves

![Elven Ranger by Oscar Ezquerra, Elf Ranger by Conor Burke and Elven Shock Troopers by Un Lee](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*1q-haJotDhn_NaRjLRxc0g.jpeg)

Standard fantasy Elf. _See:_ **_every fantasy book ever._**

Maybe a little bit less "ethereal" than you've seen in The Lord of the Rings, D&D elves live to be around 700, are slightly shorter than humans, and can't stare into sinks to see the future. They are, however, real aloof, in touch with nature, enjoy mucking about with bows, etc. You get it. **_Hippies._**

Quite magical, they get loads of bonuses to magic related saving throws and checks. Plus you get extraordinary sight and hearing. **_And you get to act super pompous_.**

## Half-Elves

![Half-Elf Witcher Wiki, Half-Elf Crowfall Wiki, Trey by Milica Jevtic and Gods & Kings: Endless War Wiki](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*fN_PwPbxJPnwspK2wd8i3w.jpeg)

Like the idea of being a magical, bow-wielding, long-eared fae hippy? But you're a bit of a special snowflake and don't just wanna be a **_standard_** elf?

**Half human, half elf. Best of both worlds.** But, accepted in neither. Social outcasts, looked at with fear by humans and pity by elves. Good base for an anti-hero character perhaps? _Oh, woe is me, no one likes me-_ **_fuckin grow up._**

Get some benefits of being an elf, like limited darkvision, magic resistances, plus some of your human benefits too (extra versatility, that sort of thing).

## Half-Orcs

_"As you can tell by the fact I'm reading a beginners guide to D&D on the internet, I'm not very tough in real life. Can I be tough in the game?"_

**_I gotchu' fam._** Result of cross breeding between humans and orcs by either _dark magic_ or... _natural means,_ half-orcs are exactly what you'd expect. **Big, tough, strong, angry, and so beautifully ugly.** Get big bonuses to strength and toughness-y things. Feared/hated by the other races though. _Can you imagine meeting one in a dark alley? You'd be scared too._

Tons of bonuses relating to combat, speed, weapons, etc. too. Constantly battling their "inner orc" to not lose control and **_fuck things up_.**

## Tieflings

![Dragon Age Wiki, Tiefling Warlock by Lin Romanov and Unknown](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*qL46pKFmF2o3CVuRuBD3TA.jpeg)

Do you like the TV show _Supernatural_? Are you mad that your mates are making you play D&D instead of some kind of Supernatural RPG?

**Hold your horses, check this shit out.** Imagine a sexy human. Give it a tail, horns and red eyes. Dip it in paint. Give it a "bad boy" personality.

**_That's pretty much it._** Tieflings are humans who, at some point in their ancestry, their bloodline was corrupted by _demons!_ So they look kinda like demons. Easy.

They get the kinds of bonuses you'd expect, like seeing in the dark, fire resistance, natural cunning, etc. However, pretty much everyone except other Tieflings are either terrified of them, or hate them, or both. **_Good luck making it through town without trouble._**

Make good warlocks and sorcerers, cus', you know, _evil magics!_

## Dragonborn

![Dragonborn Starpriest by Pacelic, Dragonborn Barbarian by Ted Ottosson and Dragonborn Bust by David Rodrigues](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*xH-QAz5Bzrx1S_Z8pDNLWQ.jpeg)

_You like roleplaying? You into_ **_Eragon erotic fan-fiction?_**

**_Boy do I have the race for you._** They're like dragons, but people, alright? Don't think too hard about it, you'll be fine.

Scaly. No wings, but they _can_ breathe fire/acid/poison, depending on their ancestry (once or twice a day at great effort).

Are devoted to their "birth clan", to the point of putting the clan before themselves. Think tribal, honourable people. Get some damage resistance bonuses thanks to your scales, **_hashtag that sweet natural armour_**. All the common folk will basically assume you're a monster, however.

## Gnomes

![Gnome Alchemist Engineer - Pathfinder RPG, Unknown and Gnome Barbarian by Marko Drazic](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*chUpws_EQLWI3MfQx8f8PA.jpeg)

Oh man. Gnomes. **I fuckin love Gnomes.** God-tier race.

Gnomes are cheery, silly and full of enthusiasm for all things. Think Dwarves, but even smaller, and with less _Yorkshire_ inside them. But most importantly, they're **_inventive._** Gnomes make master engineers, alchemists, chemists and the like.

Get bonuses to sneaking, some magic bonuses, some engineering/mechanical skill bonuses too. Plus, they can make gunpowder and rifles and other wacky madness. **Basically, Bilbo Baggins - another 12" + Doc Brown**

## Halflings

![Halfling Ranger - Pathfinder RPG, Halfling Alchemist - Pathfinder RPG and Halfling Rogue - Pathfinder RPG](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4080/format:webp/1*2dTttj-whnK_oK555dJciQ.jpeg)

Little people. Hobbits. Small-folk. You know, halflings.

Somewhere between a Gnome and a Dwarf, basically exactly like hobbits from the movies. Not lazy/dumb though, **halflings are smart, cunning, devious and _real_ sneaky.** Make excellent natural rogues, thieves, etc. Or bards, cus' they love playing instruments and **_420 blazin'_**

They are stout, and get bonuses to resistance and health. Also naturally brave, and not easily frightened. Are super lucky by nature, and get bonuses as such - _omg plz nerf_

## Humans

_Do you seriously need a picture or description of humans though?_

Nah, for real, I'm not describing humans, piss off.

---

_And there you go - all the races to choose from! Which do you pick?_ **_It's up to you!_**

_Perhaps you want to play a_ **_strong and silent half-orc, constantly battling his inner demons_**_, or an_ **_aloof and elegant elf, in tune with her woodland home_**_. Maybe even subvert expectations - a_ **_gnome with a thirst for revenge_**_, or a_ **_dragonborn who desperately wants to get his catering business off the ground_**_._

**_The point is, the choice is yours!_**
