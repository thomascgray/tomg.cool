_This is the 3rd, final, and simplest part of a guide to creating your character for a game of Dungeons and Dragons. If you missed the first two parts,_ **_where the fuck were you?_** _I'm disappointed in you, but you can catchup_ [_here_](/blog/2018-08-08-so-you-want-to-play-dnd-step-1-intro-and-races.html) _and_ [_here_](/blog/2018-08-10-so-you-want-to-play-dnd-step-2-classes.html)

_"Yeah, I get you're a whirling death vortex with +4 Strength and a magic axe, but like, ya know — who_ **_are_** _you?" — A DM reminding everyone D&D is a role playing game_

Great, you've chosen a **race _(your racial powers)_**, you've chosen a class (profession), now the final piece of the puzzle falls into place — **all the other shit that makes you an actual person and not just a fucking facade of an entity.**

This is really more a step by step process as opposed to a "choose one of the following", **so follow along at home!**

## Name

You're probably going to want to use some kind of [name generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/) for your mad, make-believe person, but honestly, **Paul the Half-Orc** is _way_ funnier.

## Sex

Pick one. Or _neither_. Or _multiple_. It affects the game in **_no way_**, and is purely there so your character isn't some genitalia-less action figure (unless you want to be a genitalia-less figurine-like character, in which case, **go for it**)

## Height and Weight

You can check out the PHB (or [this handy guide](http://dnd5e.wikia.com/wiki/Character_Details)) for advice on average heights and weights, but honestly, go with whatever you feel best aids the characterisation of your mighty hero.

## Other Physical Attributes

Hair colour, eye colour. Foot size. Skin pigment. Tongue width. Hand size. Toe length. Choose as many or as few details as you want, flesh out your character as you see fit.

## Alignment

Ah, this old chestnut. Alignment is a basic representation of your characters morality, based on 2 spectrums: **Lawful** to **Chaotic**, and **Good** to **Evil.** Confusion around what alignment **_actually is_** is possibly the [oldest meme in the world](https://bit.ly/2KVj2my).

## Languages

So, everyone speaks **Common** (unless specified otherwise). I know that doesn't quite make sense, but hey, we're playing a game, and you need some way to **_antagonise the locals._**

You'll probably speak some extra languages based on your race — check the PHB for those. You'll almost certainly speak at least your **racial** language (e.g Elves speak Elvish, etc.)

## Traits

**_Spice up that character with some sweet-ass traits, yo!_** Choose 2 or 3. Or 1. Or 5. Whatever you and the people who have to put up with you are comfortable with.

What kind of traits should you aim for? Sure, fun and interesting, but **aim to make them influence behaviour** and **not outright advantages or disadvantages.** For example, "_I'm smart_" is a rubbish trait, but "_I have reoccurring nightmares about drowning_", "_I'm one of 7 sisters_" or "_I never had friends growing up, I had my books_" are all interesting things you can work from.

## Ideals

Pick an ideal or two. Something positive your character strives for, **that might make her act against better judgement** or **push her to achieve greater things**. "_I always pay my debts_", "_I can't stand to see children suffer_" or "_I never hold a grudge_" are the right direction.

## Bonds

_It's in the word, fam._ Something your character is bonded with, that **they would put themselves in danger for**, or would **perhaps betray a new acquaintance to protect**. "_My village_" for a Halfling who left home to adventure, "_The people in my squadron_" for an ex-army Half-Orc or "_The memory of my children_" for a Dwarf seeking revenge.

## Flaws

_Surely you get the idea by now?_ Something that a **villain could use against you**, or that an **adversary could use to exploit you**. "_I lose my temper in no time at all_", "_I judge myself, and others, too harshly_" or "_I'm a sucker for a beautiful face_"

### And that, my good people, is that!

By following [the first](/blog/2018-08-08-so-you-want-to-play-dnd-step-1-intro-and-races.html) and [second](/blog/2018-08-10-so-you-want-to-play-dnd-step-2-classes.html) parts of this guide you chose your character _race_ and _class,_ and now you have lots of juicy details to both ground them in the world and help you role play as them.

Work with your Dungeon Master to flesh out the game-y parts of your character (hit points, weapon proficiencies, skills, etc.) and you'll be fully set to jump into a game of **Dungeons and Dragons!**

All your friends now think you're a loser, and your parents think you're a devil worshipper, **_but hey, you learned something,_** and now you get to pretend to be an Elf!

_Ah, who am I kidding,_ [_D&D is cool now._](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wd4apb/dungeons-dragons-is-officially-cool-again-115)
