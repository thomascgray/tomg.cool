Personal website for all my links and stuff.

Each refresh gives a random colour scheme!

## Blog system

You can go to https://tomg.cool/blog/ to see some longer form writing.

Its a dead simple setup;

- `_drafts` folder for `.md` files of random notes and stuff that might become an article
- `/drafts` for actual finished articles, in `.md` format
- `blog_template.html` and `build-blog.ts` for building the blog
- `/blog` folder for the finished articles as individual `.html` files, ready to be consumed by readers
