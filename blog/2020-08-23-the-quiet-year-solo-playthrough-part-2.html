          <p>Following on from <a href="/blog/2020-08-22-the-quiet-year-solo-playthrough-part-1.html">the first part</a>, let&#39;s keep going through <strong>Spring.</strong></p>
<h3>Week 5: Three</h3>
<p>Someone new arrives in the community… interesting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m liking the idea of a complete outsider who knows something that the community doesn&#39;t. Hmm, maybe they were drawn by the object that washed up in Week 2.</p>
<p><strong>I&#39;m going to add a moored boat.</strong> Someone has arrived who knows what that metal is, and is doing experiments on it. I ended up drawing it kinda like an oil tanker, which I&#39;m into as well. Who the hell are these guys? Guess we&#39;ll find out soon!</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to skip my action this week: 2 new projects completed and random boats turning up is enough action for a while.</p>

<h3>Week 6: Five</h3>
<p>How old are the oldest members? Hmm, good question… Well, the natural answer is &quot;not that old&quot; because, well — everyone has a broken immune system and no food? Plus that&#39;s why the children are so important and need to be so strongly protected.</p>
<p>If people die young, through famine and disease, I&#39;m going to say they can&#39;t even risk burying the bodies. The likelihood of infection is simply too high. <strong>I&#39;m going to add burnt out funeral pyres to the top of the map.</strong> The closest this community gets to a tangible memorial.</p>
<p>For an action, I&#39;m re-thinking of how important the children are again. <strong>I&#39;m going to have the community discover a new, grounded mech</strong> and have the community <strong>refurbish it&#39;s gun turret.</strong> It would at least help defend against whatever the <em>hell</em> is killing people at night… <strong>I add a grounded mech with a gun turret near the nursery.</strong></p>

<h3>Week 7: Ten</h3>
<p>There&#39;s another community on the map somewhere. Oh boy, it&#39;s perfect — <strong>more boats arrive.</strong> Who the hell are these lot? What do they want with the object that appeared on the shore?</p>
<p><strong>A new project too — let&#39;s get some crops going.</strong> Our people are starving, and some workable crops would be so much better than having to manually forage across the whole land for scraps of fruit. <strong>I add some fields</strong> towards the north of the nursery, and mark it as 6. It&#39;s going to take a while to cultivate seeds, prepare the soil, etc.</p>

<h3>Week 8: Jack</h3>
<p>OK, a bit of good news, finally — <strong>a good omen.</strong> What could it be though? Maybe a break though at the hospital? I like the thought that the people living their, led by Alice, have been working on a cure for the immunity deficiencies. And their experiments are showing promising results! I add a little medical tent-thing near the hospital. <strong>Science!</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll skip an action this week, and decrease our crop project by 1.</p>

<h3>Week 9: Queen</h3>
<p>And rounding out Spring, what is the most hideous in this area? I&#39;m thinking we need more of a representation of death, to be honest. This is a group of people who don&#39;t have immune systems. AND they get stalked by unknown creatures at night who don&#39;t leave behind bodies.</p>
<p>Ooh, wait! That! <strong>They find a body.</strong> Oh man, and it&#39;s something horrific. They find a corpse in the ocean, strapped to a buoy. <strong>It&#39;s bloody, mangled, half eaten.</strong> <em>How did it get out there? Why did the predator leave some of it behind?</em> Questions questions questions!</p>
<p>Something new that our community discovers? I&#39;m thinking some kind of hint of the night time predators. Maybe a den, or a nest? I add a sort of burrow to the East, near the cliff.</p>

<h2>Spring Wrap-Up</h2>
<p>And that&#39;s it for Spring! Wow, I can&#39;t believe how much you get from The Quiet Year prompts.</p>
<p>To summarise;</p>
<p><em>We&#39;ve got a group of survivors living near each other after some unexplained, apocalyptic scenario took place. They live by the coast, and have a functioning system of coastal wind turbines for energy. Not that they have a lot of use for it…</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever happened left our survivors without immune systems, so they stay separated to avoid risk of cross-infection. They live inside hollowed out tanks and combat mechs. They live off foraging for berries, mushrooms and fruit.</em></p>
<p><em>A group of survivors found a hospital, and moved in. They&#39;ve been working on a cure for</em> <strong><em>whatever</em></strong> <em>it is that&#39;s afflicting them, as best they can.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, out of nowhere, something washed up on the shore. Quickly followed by a series of ships and vessels. What is it, who are these people, and what do they want?</em></p>
<p><em>All of this, AND the survivors are dealing with some unknown threat that</em> <strong><em>kills and eats them at night.</em></strong> <em>They usually don&#39;t find bodies, but one has just been found… tied to a buoy out at sea.</em> <strong><em>What!?</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks for reading! I&#39;m having a ton of fun with this, The Quiet Year is proving to be as great as I thought it&#39;d be.</p>
<p>Summer next! I&#39;m genuinely curious as to whats in store for our community as we head further into the year…</p>
